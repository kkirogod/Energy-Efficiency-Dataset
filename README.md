# Energy-Efficiency-Dataset
Data mining project carried out on the Energy Efficiency Dataset (UCI).

The objective is to handle classical **regression** algorithms with the scikit learn library, after using the corresponding preprocessing, study the effect of its parameters in order to select the most appropriate ones, and compare and analyze the results obtained with the different algorithms to determine the most suitable model for this problem.
